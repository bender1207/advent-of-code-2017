# Advent of Code 2017 solutions

This repository contains solutions to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) 
advent calendar.

The solutions for Day 1-7 are in C/C++ and the rest are in Scala.

## Warning

The solutions should not be viewed as idiomatic code or even good code 
at all. They are mainly written to solve the problem at hand, and as a way
to increase my familiarity with C/C++ and Scala.
